The probability of rolling a set of dice is the ratio of the number of ways the dice can land to the total number of possible outcomes.  For example, if you roll a set of six-sided dice, there are 6^6 = 46,656 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling a specific set of dice is 1/46,656.  This is because there are 6^6 = 46,656 ways the dice can land, and each of these outcomes has a probability of 1/46,656.  This is a very small probability, but it’s still possible to roll a specific set of dice.  The probability of rolling a specific set of dice is also affected by the number of dice you roll, and the number of sides on each die.  For example, if you roll a set of four six-sided dice, there are 6^4 = 1,296 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling a specific set of dice is 1/1,296.  This is a much higher probability than rolling a set of six six-sided dice, because there are more possible outcomes.
