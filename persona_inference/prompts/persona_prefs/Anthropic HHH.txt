You will be given the personas of two users (Persona 1 and Persona 2). Each persona is a very short, specific, one-sentence description of a user's preference and contains reasoning for the types of responses that user prefers. Your task is to decide which of the two personas is better. Respond with just "1" or "2" denoting whether Persona 1 or Persona 2 is better, respectively.
