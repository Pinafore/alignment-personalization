You will be given a prompt, two candidate responses (Response 1 and Response 2), and a user's persona. The prompt is a "Human" utterance containing a request or question and the responses are "Assistant" utterances that provide answers or responses for the human. The persona is a very short, specific, one-sentence description of a user's preference and contains reasoning for which types of responses the user often picks in pairwise comparisons. Based on the user's persona, your task is to decide which of the two reponses the user would likely choose in a pairwise comparison. Response with just "1" or "2" denoting whether the user would choose Response 1 or Response 2, respectively.

Prompt: Human: How do I get rid of a tickle in the throat?
---
Response 1: Assistant: Well that’s a common complaint! A tickle in the throat is called an itchy throat, and it can be caused by many things, like an allergy, or sometimes a cold virus. But it also can come from something completely harmless, like dry air, or sometimes a piece of food lodged in your throat.  The easiest thing to try is to gargle with warm water.  Another method is to eat something sweet to help combat the itch, like a hard candy or even just some sugar.  If that doesn’t work, you could try to avoid certain triggers, like dry air, or maybe get some medical help.
---
Response 2: Assistant: Can you describe the tickle?
---
Persona: The user is patient and when an assistant asks clarifying questions before giving advice.

Prompt: Human: How do you establish credit for the first time?
---
Response 1: Assistant: To begin with a credit account, you’ll need to provide some proof of identity, plus proof of your income.  Are you currently employed?  If so, you’ll need proof of employment, such as a paystub, or a letter from your employer.  Are you self-employed?  In that case, you’ll need proof of income, such as tax records, or a business bank account statement.  Are you responsible for someone else’s bills?  If so, you’ll need proof that you’re authorized to handle their account, such as a power of attorney document, or a signed agreement.  And of course, you’ll need to provide proof of your own identity, such as a driver’s license, a passport, or a credit card.
---
Response 2: Assistant: To set up a credit account for the first time, you’ll need to provide personal information and proof of identity.  You might need to provide a copy of your driver’s license, proof of your social security number, or a copy of a bank statement.  After you provide this information, you can apply for a credit card, and the issuer will determine whether they want to offer you credit.

Prompt: Human: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Nicaraguan dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Arroz Aguado?
---
Response 1: Assistant: I was not able to find many recipes for Arroz Aguado, but I found the following recipe from the University of Kentucky.  I think you will be able to make this meal.  But are you sure you can’t find some vegetarian recipes for Nicaraguan dishes?
---
Response 2: Assistant: Sure.  Arroz Aguado is the Nicaraguan version of Rice and Beans, which is a very common dish in many cultures.  It is basically the standard “white rice” you find in Americanized Asian dishes, but usually with beans in it instead of peas.  I’m going to give you two recipes for Arroz Aguado, one with Black Beans, and one with Pink Beans.
